# ðŸ’» Rating Component | Frontend Mentor

## ðŸ“– Description

The Interactive Rating Component is a challenge provided by *Frontend Mentor*. It was made with *sematic HTML*, *Sass pre-processor* to handle *CSS* and *JQuery* with *JavaScript*. Codding this little component was a fun challenge and opportunity to practice with JQuery. I always see many projects using it, so I thought it would be nice to understand how it works.

# üíª Rating Component | Frontend Mentor

## üìñ Description

The Interactive Rating Component is a challenge provided by *Frontend Mentor*. It was made with *sematic HTML*, *Sass pre-processor* to handle *CSS* and *JQuery* with *JavaScript*. Codding this little component was a fun challenge and opportunity to practice with JQuery. I always see many projects using it, so I thought it would be nice to understand how it works.

## üî® Build with

* Semantic HTML
* CSS + Sass pre-processor
* BEM Naming Convention
* JavaScript
* JQuery
* Visual Studio Code (Codium)

## ‚è≥ Continued development

I would like to improve the way I made it responsive, it doesn't fit very well in smaller screens. I also would like to make it as much accessible as possible, but this is a thing that I'm still researching and improving.
